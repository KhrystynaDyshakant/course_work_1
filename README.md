I created an API that allows you to receive and transfer information about interactive advertising panels in supermarkets, their number, the department in which the panel is located, the manufacturer of the panel, technical characteristics, addresses of supermarkets.
Step-by-step instructions:
I wrote classes controllers, services, writers and their interfaces using the lombok library;
implemented REST services for all entities using Spring Boot: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE;
divided classes into packages;
implemented data storage and reading them from a csv file; used a hash map to read all entities from the file; used maven to build the project;
checked her code using Spotbugs and checkstyle;
wrote unit tests for checking the logic of recording and searching for files on the file system; threw the project on github
